Week 12/13: 
Unfortunately, during week 12 our tutors weren't here for this week but I received some feedback from my peers, Elijah and Peran, we helped each other out and gave each other constructive criticism, During week 13 was our last week of class so we had to finish our projects and almost complete our SKO, the class was held just to get that final bit of feedback from our tutors.
